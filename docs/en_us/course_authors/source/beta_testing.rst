Beta Testing a Course
#############################

When a course is being designed in Studio, the course team can choose **View Live** to assess progress, find problems, and mimic the student experience. A more thorough test is done by giving early access to the course to beta testers who interact with the course exactly as students will. Beta testers identify issues, find bugs, and experience errors before enrolled students do. 

Beta testers access the course early, but otherwise see and use it as students do. They use their own computers and internet connections to view the videos, follow the links, and complete the problems. They help you make sure that everything works as it should before the course start date. 

==========================================
How Beta Testers See Course Content
==========================================

Beta testers see course content in the LMS: 

+-------------------------------------------+------+------+
|                                           | Yes  |  No  |
+===========================================+======+======+
| Before the Course Start Date              |  X   |      |
+-------------------------------------------+------+------+
| Before the section Release Day            |  X   |      |
+-------------------------------------------+------+------+
| Before the subsection Release Day         |  X   |      |
+-------------------------------------------+------+------+
| Before the unit is Public                 |      |   X  |
+-------------------------------------------+------+------+
| Before a live unit is replaced by a draft |      |   X  |
+-------------------------------------------+------+------+

The course team can continue to add content in Studio after the beta test begins. When new content is ready for testing, be sure to change the **Visibility** setting for any units that are Private to Public. See :ref:`Units`.

===========================
The Beta Testing Process
===========================

During a beta test, you gather information about the experience of taking your course in an effort to improve its quality. The phases of the beta testing process, and questions to consider as you prepare for each phase, follow.

#. Planning

  What are the objectives? What is the schedule for testing? 

#. Recruitment

  How many testers do you need? How much time do you expect testers to spend? When do you need them to complete their feedback? 

#. Provide access to your course

  Will testers have access to your entire course, or will you make units available at different times?

#. Collect feedback

  How will testers provide their feedback? Who checks for feedback, and how often?  

#. Evaluate feedback

  How is feedback evaluated? Who decides what changes to make as a result, and on what schedule?

#. Conclusion

  How do you acknowledge the efforts of your testers? What will you share with them about the results of their efforts? 

***************************************
Qualities of Good Beta Testers
***************************************

A beta test is valuable in part because it is unscripted. Your beta testers are not following a predetermined series of steps, or using a particular computer environment, when they access your course. When you recruit your beta testers, however, certain skills and characteristics can be helpful.

* Curiosity

* Solid communication skills: the ability to identify and report problems to course staff. 

* Attention to detail

Your beta testers should also have varying levels of knowledge about the course content:

* To recognize when material is wrong or missing, at least one tester should know the content well.

* To identify material that is unclear, at least one tester should be less familiar with the content. 

Depending on the objectives you set for your beta test, you may also want to recruit testers who use assistive technologies, who have different native languages, or who have varying levels of familiarity with computer software.

*********************************
Define the Testing Period
*********************************

To define the start of the beta test, you specify a number of days before the **Course Start Date**. 

#. In Studio, select **Settings** > **Advanced Settings**.

#. Scroll down to the ``days_early_for_beta`` **Policy Key**.

#. Set the **Policy Value** to the number of days before the **Course Start Date** that you want beta testers to begin to access your course.

#. Click **Save Changes**.

*********************************
Add the Beta Testers
*********************************

Before you can add beta testers:

* You need the email address of each beta tester. 

* Each beta tester must register a user account for that email address and be enrolled in your course. 

  If the beta test starts before the **Enrollment Start Date**, testers cannot enroll themselves. To streamline this procees, enroll the beta testers and select the **Auto Enroll** and **Notify students by email** options. See :ref:`Enrollment`.

To add a beta tester:

#. View the live version of your course.

#. Click **Instructor** then **Try New Beta Dashboard**.

#. Click **Membership**.

#. In the Administration List Management section, use the drop-down list to select **Beta Testers**.

#. Under the list of users who currently have that role, enter an email address and click **Add Beta Tester**.

  * If you add beta testers after the defined start of the beta test, they see your course on their dashboards when they log in. 

  * If you add beta testers before the test starts, they do not see your course. You may need to remind them when the test begins. 

To remove the Beta Testers role, view the list of beta testers and then click revoke access (the **X**) next to that email address. 

-----------------------------------------
About Using Course Staff as Beta Testers 
-----------------------------------------

Course staff can provide valuable feedback about your course. However, they are typically stakeholders in the success of your course and have a significant amount of knowledge about it. As a result, they can be too close to the course to interact with it in the same way as students will. They can also be either reluctant to provide feedback, or overly zealous.

If you do want a staff member to be a beta tester, you must use a different, second email address for this additional role. The privileges of the course staff role override those of a beta tester, so a second registration on the site, and enrollment in the course, are necessary. When beta testing, the email address that has the beta tester role must be used to log in.

*********************************
What to Test
*********************************

Beta testers should interact with everything in the course. 

* Click all links.

* Watch all videos.

* Download video transcripts and other files.

* Complete all problems. 

* Verify that correct answers are identified with a green check mark, and other answers are identified with a red X. (Testers should be given a list of the correct answers, but should be sure to attempt other answers as well.)

As they work, beta testers log all issues, changes, errors, and questions for the course team.
